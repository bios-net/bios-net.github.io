The network is concerned with current modes of reworking and regulating life as a collective phenomenon. The network provides a forum to discuss current empirical projects and to deepen conceptual debates. We aim to provide a safe space for exchange among researchers from different backgrouunds. The network is open for ideas and activities. 

Currently, we are a group of geographers, anthopologists mostly related to the german speaking academia.
